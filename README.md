FLORA TECH PROBE
Using a deep learning model and a Raspberry Pi 4, I created a gadget that defends plants from outside dangers.
It instantly sounds an alert and notifies the owner in real time using Telegram bot notifications.
For improved accuracy and responsiveness, the project combines deep learning, artificial intelligence, and natural
language processing with TensorFlow and YOLO for object identification.
it continuously monitors the wind speed, temperature and humidity to know the well being of the plant.
e.g. Communicated effectively and built rapport with a wide range of customers in a fast-paced environment to deliver
an outstanding level of customer service.
